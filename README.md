Pokémon Analytics: Unveiling Insights Through Tableau

Description:
This project, undertaken during my university studies, utilizes Tableau to explore the fascinating world of Pokémon. Through interactive dashboards and engaging stories, I delved into various aspects of these captivating creatures.
This project not only served as a learning experience in data visualization with Tableau, but also allowed me to explore my passion for Pokémon and uncover fascinating insights from a data-driven perspective.

Data Source: The data for this project was obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com, a popular platform for data science and machine learning.

The image shows a graph that displays the type effectiveness of various Pokemon against a Water-type opponent. The x-axis lists different Pokemon types, while the y-axis shows a multiplier value. Higher values on the y-axis indicate greater effectiveness against a Water-type opponent. For example, the graph shows that Electric-type Pokemon have a multiplier of 2 against Water-type Pokemon, while Grass-type Pokemon have a multiplier of 0.5.

The image displays a table that shows various moves a Water-type Pokémon can learn. The table has columns for Category, Name, Effect, PP, Cat. and Namel.

Category: This column specifies the category of the move, which can be either "Physical" or "Special."
Name: This column lists the name of the move.
Effect: This column describes the additional effect the move may have, such as lowering the opponent's Defense or having a high critical hit ratio.
PP: This column shows the Power Points (PP) of the move, which indicates how many times the Pokémon can use the move before needing to recharge.
Cat.: This column likely refers to the "Category" again but is abbreviated.
Namel: This column might be a misspelling of "Name" and seems to repeat the move name.


Limitations:

It is important to acknowledge that the data used in this project may not have been entirely comprehensive. While Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com is a valuable resource for open-source datasets, there is always the possibility of missing information or inconsistencies.

Future Work:

This project opens doors for further exploration. Future iterations could incorporate additional data sources to address potential limitations and delve deeper into specific aspects, such as analyzing move effectiveness or exploring the competitive landscape of the Pokémon world.
