Pokémon Analytics: Unveiling Insights Through Tableau

Description:
This project, undertaken during my university studies, utilizes Tableau to explore the fascinating world of Pokémon. Through interactive dashboards and engaging stories, I delved into various aspects of these captivating creatures.
This project not only served as a learning experience in data visualization with Tableau, but also allowed me to explore my passion for Pokémon and uncover fascinating insights from a data-driven perspective.

Data Source: The data for this project was obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com, a popular platform for data science and machine learning.

The image shows a graph that displays the type effectiveness of various Pokemon against a Water-type opponent. The x-axis lists different Pokemon types, while the y-axis shows a multiplier value. Higher values on the y-axis indicate greater effectiveness against a Water-type opponent. For example, the graph shows that Electric-type Pokemon have a multiplier of 2 against Water-type Pokemon, while Grass-type Pokemon have a multiplier of 0.5.

The top right corner of the image displays the title "Finding the most effective Pokemon against a type WATER opponent".


Limitations:

It is important to acknowledge that the data used in this project may not have been entirely comprehensive. While Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com is a valuable resource for open-source datasets, there is always the possibility of missing information or inconsistencies.

Future Work:

This project opens doors for further exploration. Future iterations could incorporate additional data sources to address potential limitations and delve deeper into specific aspects, such as analyzing move effectiveness or exploring the competitive landscape of the Pokémon world.
